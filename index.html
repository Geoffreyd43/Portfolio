      <p style="padding: 25px;">Hi! My name is Geoffrey Dodd, and welcome to my personal blog! As a
        fourth year computer sciene major, I found inspiration to create this as a portfolio for
       my New Media Certificate at the University of Georgia. Please enjoy!</p>
      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 2019 I interned at geothinQ as a GIS intern. This experience was fantastic for me because
        it allowed me to learn a lot about maps and data. I developed a passion for data after creating a makeshift
        classifier for zoning data we received. I also learned the python-based web framework Django, which helped me
        understand modern web programming in a professional setting better.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2020 I interned at NCR Corporation as a Software Engineer intern. I honed in on my full stack
          web programming skills here as well, learning and working with Angular, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to implement
        a digital dining experience for websites owned by small businesses. This experience was particularly rewarding
        because I felt like the work I was doing truly helped these businesses safely continue to stay open amid the COVID-19
        pandemic.</p>
      <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
        <p>I recently accepted a full time position as a Software Engineer at NCR Corporation following my graduation in
        May of 2021. I am incredibly excited for the opportunity to continue growing my skills and work with such amazing
        people.</p>
