        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The New Media Certificate is a program in UGA's New Media Institute that allows students of all majors to learn
         about modern media and the applications of technology within it. Students are given many practical projects while
          having the opportunity to work on a capstone project with a real company at the end of the certificate.</p>

        <h3>What have I gotten from it?</h3>
        <p>I personally have really enjoyed the one class I have taken so far. As a computer science major, I will frequently
        work with various technology, but this certificate has broadened my view beyond just the tech side of things. I
        have learned to look at the products as a whole from appearance to tech stack to content and meaning.</p>
